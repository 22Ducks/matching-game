# Duck22's Matching Game!
Test your memory with this Vite and React powered application! Select your card style and amount, and do your best to find all the pairs by clicking on the cards.

Features include: 3 different preset card amounts, 2 preset card appearances, previews of the card presets, a timer showcasing how long the game has been running, and an easy way to play again with the same settings after a game.
